Space Apps Challenge â€“ Ruse is organized for a fifth year in the city of Ruse, Bulgaria.

MORE THAN 40 TEAMS AND 130 PARTICIPANTS!
Our goal has always been to motivate young people to love science, question everything, and be inspired.
Our contestants have the opportunity to propose new and interesting ideas, small-scale prototypes, software products, and others that could potentially improve life on Earth or contribute to the exploration of space.

The event is organized through a partnership among the University of Ruse, the Bulgarian science community, business organizations, NGOs, and student volunteers.

The host organization, the University of Ruse, is an educational and research center, training specialists in a wide range of engineering, economic, and humanitarian degree programs, and conducting fundamental and applied research. Today, over 9 000 students and 150 Ph.D. students are studying at the University of Ruse.
